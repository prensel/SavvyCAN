First we get upgrade to the latest Qt5 package

#sudo apt-get update
#sudo apt-get upgrade
#sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev
#sudo apt-get install qt5-default

Download a Qt version (> 5.8) with serialport and serialusb support

#wget http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.9/5.9.2/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.9.2.run

Make the downloaded file executable

#chmod +x ./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.9.2.run

Run the install program either as sudo or regular user
#sudo ./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.9.2.run

A new Window will open and press Enter, then fill in your existing Qt account info to start the process.
If you dont have a Qt account just create one.
Press Next on the default installation directory /opt/Qt5.9.2
Select component ('Desktop gcc 64-bit' and 'Sources') and press Next
Accept the license agreement and press Install and press Finish when done.
It takes a while to install all of the files so just wait until it is finished.

Verify the installed version

#/opt/Qt5.9.2/5.9.2/gcc_64/bin/qmake -v

Download the latest branch of SavvyCAN from Github

#git clone https://github.com/collin80/SavvyCAN.git

Change into the new source directory
#cd SavvyCAN

Run the qmake command from the latest downloaded version
#/opt/Qt5.9.2/5.9.2/gcc_64/bin/qmake

A new stash file is created
Now run the 'make' command
#make

If everything works out well it will compile without error.

Create the install script to install the binaries and create a desktop link
#make install

AND run the install script to actually install it...


# ./install

When everything is ok just click on the newly created SavvyCAN link/icon, 
confirm its an executable and run the program
